Movie Collection Console App with User and Admin functionality

Project Description

This project was created to practice OOP functionality, inheritance, CRUD, and Xunit testing. 

The console application was created with a default set of movies. The user has the ability to only view  movies. 

The user can search by actor, genre, director, and movie name but they can't make changes. 

The admin is able to view the movies using the same search criteria as the user but they can add, edit, and delete. 

Xunit testing was done to confirm that the methods created to execute the functionality are working appropriateley. 

The Arrange, Act, and Assert structure was used for the test as well.
